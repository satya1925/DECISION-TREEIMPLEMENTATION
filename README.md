## Decision Tree Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a **Decision Tree** model using **scikit-learn**, one of the most widely used machine learning libraries in Python. The goal is to build a Decision Tree classifier that can predict or classify outcomes based on input data. Decision Trees are intuitive and interpretable models that split data into branches to arrive at a decision, making them an ideal starting point for beginners in machine learning.

## Task Description

The objective of this task is to explore and implement a Decision Tree algorithm from scratch using the `scikit-learn` library. The project follows the entire pipeline of a typical machine learning project—from importing and preparing the data to training, evaluating, and visualizing the model. The decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks, and in this project, it is specifically applied for classification.

The main goals of this task include:

- Understanding the fundamental theory behind Decision Tree models.
- Learning how the Gini Index or Entropy is used to decide optimal splits.
- Implementing a Decision Tree classifier on a real-world or sample dataset.
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and understanding potential overfitting.
- Visualizing the decision-making process to interpret how decisions are made.

This task is valuable for building a solid foundation in machine learning, especially for beginners looking to develop their skills in data handling, model training, and result interpretation.

## Features

This project includes the following components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Building**: Using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn to build the model and train it on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the decision tree using `matplotlib` and `graphviz` for better interpretability.
- **Code Documentation**: Well-commented and structured code to make it easy to understand and modify.
